* Course Tutorials

The following tutorials help introduce Python, TensorFlow, and the two autonomous driving simulations described in the class.

(Optional) Setting Up Docker and TensorFlow [ for Linux ] [ for Windows 10 Professional ]
[ for Windows 10 Home / Windows 7 ] [ for Max OS X ] – This is the easiest way to follow along with the Python/TensorFlow tutorials below.
(Optional) Implementing the Perceptron Algorithm in Python – There are other Jupyter (aka iPython) notebooks in this repo that would be useful for you to follow (including the traffic light classification notebook).
(Optional) Installing OpenCV to the TensorFlow Docker Image
DeepTraffic: Solving Traffic with Deep Reinforcement Learning
DeepTesla: End-to-End Steering Model
Getting Started

Python: Interactive Python Tutorial is a fast-paced, broad-ranging, and fun interactive introduction and overview of Python.
Machine Learning with Python: Practical Machine Learning Tutorial with Python Introduction is an in-depth but  very accessible introduction to machine learning. You can skip ahead to the Neural Networks part if you’re already comfortable with basics of regression, classification, clustering, and general data wrangling.
Neural Networks with Python: A gentle introduction to Neural Networks from Andy Thomas.
TensorFlow: Explore the official docs and tutorials from TensorFlow team or follow a gentle intro to TensorFlow from Andy Thomas.
Self-Driving Cars: The Wikipedia article on autonomous cars is a quick overview of the technology and policy side, and The First Look at How Google’s Self-Driving Car Handles City Streets is an fun write-up on the real-world result of one of its implementations.
Deep Learning Details

Deep Learning Book – An excellent comprehensive textbook on deep learning. Up to this point, the review of deep learning fundamentals have been spread across multiple books, papers, and blogs. Now it’s all together in one place.
CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition – While this Stanford class is presumably focused on computer vision, it happens to have the hands down best introduction to deep learning I’ve seen anywhere both in its notes and its video lectures.
Andrej Karpathy blog – One of the instructors of CS231n keeps a great blog with should be required reading for all interested in machine learning because its very digestable, entertaining, and doesn’t hold back on the messy details.
